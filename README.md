# ark-server-config
Our current Ark server configuration, which we run on Nitrado.

Our goals were to provide a challenging PVE server with reduced grinding.

Life is dangerous, but taming, farming and resource gathering are a bit quicker, and hunger and thirst are reduced.

Also included is a script that looks at a private-src directory and removes passwords, and copies them up a level. This is what gets pushed to git.
